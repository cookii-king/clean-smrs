## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Docker (optional for deployment)
- SQLite

### Quick Setup on Ubuntu

For users with a fresh and blank Ubuntu server, you can quickly set up the Clean-SMR platform using the following command. This command will download and execute a script that automates the installation process:

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/cookii-king/clean-smrs/raw/main/utilities/server/instructions.bash | bash
```

### Manual Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **🧩 Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cookii-king/clean-smr.git
   cd clean-smr
   ```

2. **🐍 Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **📦 Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **🗄️ Set Up Database**:
   Run the following commands to apply migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **👤 Create a Superuser**:
   You can create a superuser to access the admin panel using one of the following methods:

   - **Custom Command**:
     ```bash
     python3 manage.py create_superuser_if_none
     ```

   - **Standard Django Command**:
     ```bash
     python3 manage.py createsuperuser --username admin --email admin@cleansmrs.com
     ```

     Follow the prompts to set the username, email, and password. For example:
     - Username: admin
     - Email address: admin@cleansmrs.com
     - Password: 123456@Aa

   - **Interactive Command**:
     ```bash
     python3 manage.py createsuperuser
     ```

     This will prompt you to enter the username, email, and password interactively.

6. **▶️ Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **🌐 Access the Platform**:
   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser.
